# Get backend up and running locally

Clone the backend repository from the Ada Github into your working directory:

```
$ cd ~/projects/react-workshop
$ git clone https://github.com/adacollege/hotel-ratings-backend.git
$ cd hotel-ratings-backend
$ npm install
```

Optionally run the tests to make sure everything is working

`$ npm test`

Start the server and browse the README.md of the repository to learn how it works and how to use Postman to manually test it.

`$ npm start`
