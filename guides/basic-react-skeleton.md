We need to setup a React project. We are going to use [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and build this as a web application rather than using [Expo](https://expo.io/) to build a react native app. Later on, feel free to experiment with Expo.

## Software Requirements:

* Node.js
* npm 5.2+
* git

You can install create-react-app very simply by following the instructions on the [README of the repo](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), which are:

```
$ npx create-react-app my-app
$ cd my-app
$ npm start
```

## Alternative method

If you are unable to install node or git, you can use [Repl.it](https://repl.it/) and choose the React starter kit.
